                    <p>Muti-Level Marketing (MLM) has continually been on the rise, and numerous  top MLM companies are poised for explosive growth in 2015 and beyond. MLM is a pretty basic concept – it pays out on a “multi-level” basis. You get paid based on your level in the company, and commissions are generally passed up through levels to the top.</p>
                <p>In order to find success with any of the top MLM opportunity, it comes down to finding a company that is the right fit for you. There is a lot to consider in the decision-making process. How long has the company been around? What is the compensation plan like? Is it an opportunity that you can feel passionate about? The answers to your questions will ultimately determine your future.

                        <div>Kyani has blown all other MLM companies out of the water. Based on only three products, their company has grown. This is not a pyramid scheme as you can only have a specified number of people under you, and you all have to work together to grow your team. People can choose to just purchase the product or join your team and make money. For each person you sponsor, you will receive a check based on the level they join, allowing you to make your money back quickly.</div>

                        <div>PartyLite has been around for years and specializes in candles. This MLM company relies on home parties to showcase their products where guests can smell the variety of scents and place orders. In order for a hostess to make the most out of her show, she would need to have some of her guests do a follow on show of their own. In some cases, hostesses will join as well, and part of their earnings from their show go to purchasing their starter kit.</div>

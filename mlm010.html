MLM is a pretty basic concept – it pays out on a “multi-level” basis. You get paid based on your level in the company, and commissions are generally passed up through levels to the top.</p>

There is a lot to consider in the decision-making process. How long has the company been around? What is the compensation plan like? Is it an opportunity that you can feel passionate about? The answers to your questions will ultimately determine your future.

People can choose to just purchase the product or join your team and make money. For each person you sponsor, you will receive a check based on the level they join, allowing you to make your money back quickly.</div>
